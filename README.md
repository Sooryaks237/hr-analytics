## Methodology  
1. **Data Preparation**  
   - Cleaned and standardized records across departments and job roles.  
   - Created DAX measures for:  
     - **Attrition Rate (%)**  
     - **Average Tenure (Years)**  
     - **Overtime Penalty**  
     - **Average Monthly Income**

2. **Dashboard Development**  
   - Implemented interactive slicers for **Department**, **Job Role**, **Age Band**, **Gender**, **Overtime**, and **Business Travel**.  
   - Designed KPIs:  
     - **Headcount:** 1,470 employees  
     - **Attrition Rate:** 16.12%  
     - **Average Tenure:** 7.01 years  
     - **Average Monthly Income:** ₹6.5K  
     - **Overtime Penalty:** 0.20  

3. **Visual Components**  
   - **Top Loss Segments:** Attrition counts by department  
   - **Attrition Lift vs Overall:** Deviation of each department from the mean attrition rate  
   - **Attrition by Gender, Age Band, and Overtime**  
   - **Pay vs Churn:** Income vs attrition relationship  
   - **Attrition by Years at Company and Business Travel**
